![EgaUriJS][1]

### Introduction.
Welcome to **EgaUriJS** âˆ’ The **Open Source** library to manage **URI** (usually **URL**), designed for the **Web** and created using **OOP** style.

This wiki is the main source for **developers** who works with (or contributes to) the *EgaUriJS* project. To access this wiki markdown code you can clone the project appending the suffix `.wiki` to the URL or view it at the [wiki][2] branch, since GitHub doesn't offer a Web interface to see the wiki repository. Feel free to improve *EgaUriJS* by *[contributing to the project][3]*, *[submitting an issue][4]*, *[translating the documentation][2]* or *[giving us your feedback][5]*.
### Quick navigation.
Frozen section till the wiki is more completed.
### What makes this library especial?
*EgaUriJS* is written using OOP, giving the advantage to create simple inheritance systems that makes the library easier to use and more human-readable. Achieving those three goals is particularly difficult using a weak-typing and dynamic language such as JavaScript. In order to not make you lose time learning how to use it, modify it to adapt to your needs or not creating a not high-performance library, we took the decision to not write it using JavaScript but JavaScript supersets.

In order to use the library in a Web page you can compile/transpile the superset code to JavaScript with high-performance boosts or write your entire page using that superset and use a runtime compiler to load all your modules asynchronously.
### What supersets or languages makes use of?
*EgaUriJS* is not closed to a concrete set of languages (supersets) but we would like to hear your opinion and let us know if you want to add a new language to the project. First of all it must meet a set of conditions:

 - It must support modular programming.
 - It must be compilable or transpilable to JavaScript.
 - It must have an easy OOP syntax without having to fallbacks as **polyfills** or **shims**.
 - It must be simpler than the original language (JavaScript), because that the goal of the project.

If one of these conditions are not met, it would barely be added, BUT if you think it will have enough support by the community, it will be useful for enough users or you are willing to do the port by yourself (also we will try to help you) you can always send us your proposals. Also, it must have a minimum quality standards, e.g. the API must be the same as in the other languages (allowing exceptions for language-specific features).
The project is available in the following languages:

 - [CoffeeScript][6].
 - [TypeScript][7].
 - [Harmony][8].

### Quick usage.
